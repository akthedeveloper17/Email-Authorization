# Email Authenticity Checker

The primary goal of the project is to provide users with seamless access to key features and interactions, both via a traditional web app and directly within their email clients.

1. Web-Based Application using Streamlit
The web interface is developed using Streamlit, an open-source Python library that simplifies the process of building and deploying data-driven web applications. Streamlit was chosen for its rapid development capabilities, user-friendly UI components, and its strong support for integrating with machine learning models, APIs, and databases.

🚨 Key features of the Streamlit-based application:

✅ Interactive user interface for input and visualization.

✅ Real-time data processing and dynamic updates.

✅ Integration with backend logic, such as prediction models or data pipelines.

✅ Secure and lightweight, allowing deployment across different environments.
